## Getting Started

It's kinda easy to turn on the game, all you need to do is:
1.) Install Node.js (You just need to go to the Node.js site and download recommended version)
2.) Download this repo (You can use git but you can also just download it form github, doesn't matter)
3.) Open the folder in VSC
4.) Open the terminal in VSC
5.) Run command "npm i" to install all the dependencies
6.) Run command "npm run dev" 

Then you wait couple seconds and there will be a link with application hosted on your localhost ;) Enjoy the Game!
